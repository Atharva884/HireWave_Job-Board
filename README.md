# Unique Selling Propositions (Future Scope)
we have envisioned unique selling propositions (USPs) to enhance the platform's capabilities:
1.	Courses Recommendation for Clients:
â€¢	Clients can receive course recommendations tailored to the skills required for their projects. This feature helps clients understand the skill landscape and choose the best fit for their requirements.
2.	Skill Assessment Quiz:
â€¢	Clients can import a skill assessment quiz via Excel and post it along with the job. Users can attempt the quiz, and their scores will be reflected in their proposals. This data allows clients to shortlist users based on their skills and proficiency.
3.	Paid Courses:
â€¢	HireWave introduces paid courses as part of the business model. Users can enroll in these courses to enhance their skills, creating an additional revenue stream for the platform.
4.	Credit System:
â€¢	Users are allocated a fixed amount of credits each month (recurring). These credits can be used for various transactions within the platform, such as sending proposals, enrolling in paid courses, or boosting their profile visibility.
5.	Credit Purchase:
â€¢	Users can buy additional credits if needed, providing an additional source of income for HireWave.
6.	Profile Boosting:
â€¢	In the future, users can pay to elevate their profile visibility in searches or receive recommendations for specific job posts, improving their chances of being noticed by clients.
7.	Job Posting Limits (Credits):
â€¢	Clients can have a limit on posting jobs, referred to as "credits." This feature ensures that clients are intentional and considerate in their job postings, maintaining the quality of projects on the platform.
